## Task 0.1 — Repo + toolchain  (2026-06-08)

**Status:** complete, Validation Gate passing.

**What changed**
- Added `pyproject.toml` (uv-managed) configuring Ruff (lint + format), `mypy --strict`, and
  pytest. Dev tooling pinned: `ruff==0.14.4`, `mypy==1.18.2`, `pytest==8.4.2`.
- Created the full empty package tree under `src/vulnadvisor/` per `instructions.md`: `cli`,
  `deps`, `advisories`, `symbols`, `callgraph`, `reachability`, `engine`, `output`, `llm`,
  `model`, `store` — each with an `__init__.py` carrying a one-line docstring.
- Added `tests/` (mirrors `src/`) with one smoke test, plus `fixtures/` and `benchmarks/`
  placeholders.
- Added `README.md` (one-liner + run instructions), this `PROGRESS.md`, and `.gitignore`.

**Why these choices**
- `requires-python = ">=3.12"` per the stack rule (we analyze 3.12+ Python; local env is 3.13).
- `hatchling` build backend with an explicit `src/` layout so the package is importable and
  installable without extra config.
- Ruff rule set `E,F,I,UP,B,SIM,D` with the Google docstring convention enforces module
  docstrings from day one; `tests/*` is exempt from docstring (`D`) rules.
- Added one trivial smoke test so `pytest` exits 0 (an empty suite exits 5 = "no tests
  collected", which would read as a failed gate).

**Open questions**
- GitHub remote is not yet configured (`origin`). Push discipline can't run until the remote
  exists — flagging for setup before/at Task 0.2.
